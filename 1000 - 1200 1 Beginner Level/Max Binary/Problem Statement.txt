Max Binary
Chef has a binary strings 
S
S of length 
N
N, and an integer 
K
K.
Hitesh wants to maximize the decimal representation of 
S
S using 
K
K operations of the following type:

Type 
1
1: Insert 
0
0 at any position in the string.
Type 
2
2: Change any 
0
0 to 
1
1.
Help Hitesh find the modified string with maximum possible decimal representation after performing at most 
K
K operations.

Note that the decimal representation of a binary string refers to the numeric value it represents when converted to the decimal number system. For instance, the decimal representation of 
101
101 will be 
5
5 
(
