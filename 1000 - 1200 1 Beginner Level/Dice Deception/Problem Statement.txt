Dice Deception

Alice and Bob are playing a board game.
On their turn, a player must roll N standard 6-sided dice, and their action will be determined by the sum of values on the top faces of the N dice.

On a certain turn of Alice, she rolls the dice and obtains the sequence of values A1,A2,â€¦,AN on the top faces.
However, Bob isn't paying attention, allowing Alice to cheat a little!

Alice can choose a die, and flip it - so the opposite face is upward.
Note that these are standard 6-sided dice, so the sum of values on opposite faces is 7. That is:

1 is opposite to 6.
2 is opposite to 5.
3 is opposite to 4.
So as to not make Bob suspicious, Alice can perform this flipping operation at most K times.
What's the maximum score (i.e, sum of values of top faces of the dice) she can obtain?
