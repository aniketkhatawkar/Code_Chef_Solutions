String protocol
An input string S of length N is transferred through the network using a special protocol. The protocol can send the string through a series of operations. 
In one operation, we can choose a lowercase english alphabet C and do one of the following:

Transfer 1 copy of C through the network.
Transfer 2 copies of C through the network.
Each of the above transfers take 1 unit of time.

Find the minimum time in which we can transfer the entire string S through the network.
