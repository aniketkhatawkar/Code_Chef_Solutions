Final Sum
Chef has an array 
A
A of length 
N
N. In one operation, Chef can:

Choose any subarray 
[
L
,
R
]
[L,R] 
(
1

R
≤

)
(1≤L≤R≤N);
Add

Chef performed 
Q
Q such operations where the 
i

i 
th
  operation was performed on the subarray 
[
L
i
,
R
i
]
[L 
i
​
 ,R 
i
​
 ].

Determine the final sum of the array after these 
Q
Q operations.

Note that a subarray is formed by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the array.
