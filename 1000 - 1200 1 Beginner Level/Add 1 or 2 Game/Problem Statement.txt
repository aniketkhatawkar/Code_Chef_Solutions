Add 1 or 2 Game
Alice and Bob play a game.
There is an integer X, which is initially 0. On their turn,
 Alice or Bob can choose to increment X by either 1 or 2.

The game ends as soon as Xâ‰¥N holds. When the game ends, 
Bob wins the game if X=N, otherwise Alice wins the game.
Alice goes first, and the players alternate turns.
If both players play optimally, predict the winner.
