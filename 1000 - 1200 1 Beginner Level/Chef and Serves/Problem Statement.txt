Chef and Serves

In a regular table tennis match, the player who serves changes every time after 2 points are scored, regardless of which players scored them.

Chef and Cook are playing a different match â€” they decided that the player who serves would change every time after K points are scored instead (again regardless of which players scored them). When the game starts, it's Chef's turn to serve.

You are given the current number of points scored by Chef and Cook (P1 and P2 respectively). Find out whether Chef or Cook has to serve next.
