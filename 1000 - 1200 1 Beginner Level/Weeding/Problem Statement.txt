Weeding
Chef purchased a new herbicide, and now wants to test its effectiveness.

Initially, there are no weeds in Chef's garden.
For each i=1,2,3,…,N, exactly one new weed will pop up in the garden at the start of day A i .
It is known that A1<A2<…<A N.

Chef can spray the herbicide at most once per day.
Any weed that receives the spray K or more times in total will die.

Chef would like to know: is it possible that after M days, all the weeds are gone?
