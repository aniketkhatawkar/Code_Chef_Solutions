Program Your Own CALCULATOR

Write a program to obtain 2 numbers 
( A and B) and an arithmetic operator (C)
 and then design a calculator depending upon the operator entered by the user.

So for example if C="+", you have to sum the two numbers.

If C="-", you have to subtract the two numbers.

If C=" * ", you have to print the product.

If C=" / ", you have to divide the two numbers.
