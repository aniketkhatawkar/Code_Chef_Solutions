Split N
Kulyash is given an integer 
N
N. His task is to break 
N
N into some number of (integer) powers of 
2
2.

TO achieve this, he can perform the following operation several times (possibly, zero):

Choose an integer 
X
X which he already has, and break 
X
X into 
2
2 integer parts (
Y
Y and 
Z
Z) such that 
X
=
Y
+
Z
X=Y+Z.
Find the minimum number of operations required by Kulyash to accomplish his task.
