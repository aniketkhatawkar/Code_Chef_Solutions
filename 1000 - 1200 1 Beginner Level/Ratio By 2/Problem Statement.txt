Ratio By 2
You have 2 positive integers X and Y.

In one operation, you can change the value of one of the integers by 1 or −1.

Find the minimum number of operations needed to ensure that either 
X≥(2⋅Y) or Y≥(2⋅X), i.e. either X is at least twice as large as Y, or Y is at least twice as large as X.
