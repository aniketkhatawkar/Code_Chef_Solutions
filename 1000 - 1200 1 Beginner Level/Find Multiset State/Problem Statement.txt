Find Multiset State
You are given an array A of length N, along with an integer K.
It is known that A is sorted in non-descending order, that is, Ai≤A i+1 for every 1≤i<N.

Repeat the following three-step operation K times:

First, find min(A)=X and max(A)=Y, i.e. the minimum and maximum elements in the array.
Delete X and Y from A (if there exists multiple occurrences, delete only 1)
Append X+Y to the back of A.
Note that after this, the length of A will have decreased by 1.
For example, if A=[1,1,2,3], performing the operation once will result in 
A=[1,2,4], because we delete one occurrence of the maximum and minimum elements (
3 and 1 respectively), and append their sum 
3+1=4 to the array.

Find the final array A after all K operations have been performed.
