Chef and Strings

Having already mastered cooking, Chef has now decided to learn how to play the guitar. Often while trying to play a song,
Chef has to skip several strings to reach the string he has to pluck. 
Eg. he may have to pluck the 1 st string and then the 6 th string. This is easy in guitars with only 
6 strings; However, Chef is playing a guitar with 10 6 strings. In order to simplify his task, 
Chef wants you to write a program that will tell him the total number of strings he has to skip while playing his favourite song.

This is how guitar strings are numbered (In ascending order from right to left). Eg. to switch from string 
1 to 6, Chef would have to skip 4 strings (2,3,4,5).
