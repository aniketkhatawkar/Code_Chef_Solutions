Chef has N bags and an integer X. The ith bag contains Ai coins such that A i≤X.

In one operation, Chef can:
Pick any bag and increase its coins to X. 
Formally, if he choses the i th bag, he can set Ai=X.
Given that the cost of performing each operation is C(C≤X) coins and Chef can perform the above operation any (possibly zero) number of times, 
determine the maximum value of (∑ i=1NA i) − (total cost paid by Chef),

if Chef performs the operations optimally.
