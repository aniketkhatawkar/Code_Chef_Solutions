Binary String Cost

According to the new tax scheme, 
a new tax called the binary string tax was introduced! 
JJ has a binary string S of length N. 
According to the tax scheme, 
for every occurrence of 01 in S, 
a tax of X rupees will be charged, 
while for every occurrence of 10 in S, 
a tax of Y rupees will be charged.

For example, if 
X=5, Y=7 and S=11010, 
then S has 1 occurrence of 01 and 2 occurrences of 10, 
so the tax charged =5⋅1+7⋅2=19

JJ can rearrange the string S in any way he wants. 
He wants to minimize the amount of tax he has to pay. 
Can you help him do so?
