Ups and Downs

Problem description
You will be given a zero-indexed array A. You need to rearrange its elements in such a way that the following conditions are satisfied:

A[i] ≤ A[i+1] if i is even.
A[i] ≥ A[i+1] if i is odd.
In other words the following inequality should hold: A[0] ≤ A[1] ≥ A[2] ≤ A[3] ≥ A[4], and so on. Operations ≤ and ≥ should alter.
