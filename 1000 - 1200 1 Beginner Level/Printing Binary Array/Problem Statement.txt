Printing Binary Array
Consider a binary array 
B
=
B
1
,
B
2
,
…
,
B
M
B=B 
1
​
 ,B 
2
​
 ,…,B 
M
​
  of length 
M
M. Being a binary array means that every 
B
i
B 
i
​
  is either 
0
0 or 
1
1.
S
c
o
r
e
(
B
)
Score(B) is defined as the number of indices 
i
i 
(
(where 
1
≤
i
<
M
)
1≤i<M) such that 
B
i
≠
B
i
+
1
B 
i
​
 =B 
i+1
​
 .

You are given a binary array 
A
=
A
1
,
A
2
,
…
,
A
N
A=A 
1
​
 ,A 
2
​
 ,…,A 
N
​
  of length 
N
N. Print a binary array 
C
C of length 
N
N such that

A
≠
C
A=C, and
S
c
o
r
e
(
A
)
=
S
c
o
r
e
(
C
)
Score(A)=Score(C).
That is, print a binary array 
C
C which is not identical to 
A
A, but has the same Score as that of 
A
A.

It can be proven that such a 
C
C always exists.
