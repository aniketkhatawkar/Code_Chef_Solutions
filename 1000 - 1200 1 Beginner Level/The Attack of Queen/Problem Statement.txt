The Attack of Queen
Chef has started developing interest in playing chess, and was learning how the Queen moves.

Chef has an empty NÃ—N chessboard. He places a Queen at (X,Y) and wonders - What are the number of cells that are under attack by the Queen?

Notes:

The top-left cell is (1,1), the top-right cell is (1,N), the bottom-left cell is 
(N,1) and the bottom-right cell is (N,N).
The Queen can be moved any number of unoccupied cells in a straight line vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
The cell on which the Queen is present, is not said to be under attack by the Queen.
