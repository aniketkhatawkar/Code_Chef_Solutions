Chef decided to buy a new tablet. His budget is 
B, so he cannot buy a tablet whose price is greater than 
B. Other than that, he only has one criterion â€” the area of the tablet's screen should be as large as possible. Of course, the screen of a tablet is always a rectangle.

Chef has visited some tablet shops and listed all of his options. In total, there are 
N available tablets, numbered 
1 through 
N. For each valid 
i, the 
i-th tablet has width 
Wi, height 
Hiand price Pi.

Help Chef choose a tablet which he should buy and find the area of such a tablet's screen, or determine that he cannot buy any tablet.
