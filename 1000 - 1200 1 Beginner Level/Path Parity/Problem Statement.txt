Path Parity
You are given an integer 
N
N. Let 
A
A be an 
N
×
N
N×N grid such that 
A
i
,
j
=
i
+
N
⋅
(
j
−
1
)
A 
i,j
​
 =i+N⋅(j−1) for 
1
≤
i
,
j
≤
N
1≤i,j≤N. For example, if 
N
=
4
N=4 the grid looks like:



You start at the top left corner of the grid, i.e, cell 
(
1
,
1
)
(1,1). You would like to reach the bottom-right corner, cell 
(
N
,
N
)
(N,N). To do so, whenever you are at cell 
(
i
,
j
)
(i,j), you can move to either cell 
(
i
+
1
,
j
)
(i+1,j) or cell 
(
i
,
j
+
1
)
(i,j+1) provided that the corresponding cell lies within the grid (more informally, you can make one step down or one step right).

The score of a path you take to reach 
(
N
,
N
)
(N,N) is the sum of all the numbers on that path.

You are given an integer 
K
K that is either 
0
0 or 
1
1. Is there a path reaching 
(
N
,
N
)
(N,N) such that the parity of its score is 
K
K?

Recall that the parity of an integer is the (non-negative) remainder obtained when dividing it by 
2
2. For example, the parity of 
246
246 is 
0
0 and the parity of 
11
11 is 
1
1. In other words, an even number has parity 
0
0 and an odd number has parity 
1
1.
