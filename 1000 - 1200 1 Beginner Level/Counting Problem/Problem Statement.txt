Counting Problem
You are given an array A=[A1,A2,…,A N].Is it possible to partition 
A into two non-empty subsequences S1 and S2 such that 
sum(S1)×sum(S 2) is odd? Here, sum(S1) denotes the sum of elements in 
S1, and 
sum(S 2) is defined similarly.

Note: S1 and S2 must partition A, that is: S1 and S2 must be non-empty
Every element of A must be in either S1 or S2 S1 and S2
​must be disjoint (in terms of which indices their subsequences represent)
