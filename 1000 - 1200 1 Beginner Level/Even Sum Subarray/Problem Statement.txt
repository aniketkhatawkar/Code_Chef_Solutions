Even Sum Subarray

Given an array A of size N, find the size of the largest subarray of A which has an even sum.
For example, for the array 
[2,1,2] the answer is just 1 as the largest subarray with an even sum is [2].
Note that a subarray is a contiguous part of an array. 
For the array [1,3,2], some possible subarrays are [1],[2],[1,3],[1,3,2]. 
However, [1,2] is not a subarray for this array.
