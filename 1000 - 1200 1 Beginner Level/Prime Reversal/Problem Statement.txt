Prime Reversal
You are given two binary strings Aand B, each of length N. 
You can perform the following operation on string A any number of times:

Select a prime number X.
Choose any substring of string A having length X and reverse the substring.
Determine whether you can make the string A equal to B using any (possibly zero) number of operations.

A substring is obtained by deleting some (possibly zero) elements from the beginning and some (possibly zero) elements from the end of the string.
