Distinct Opposite Sums
Given an even integer 
N

It is guaranteed that a possible solution always exists. If multiple such permutations exist, print any.

Note that, a permutation 
P
P of length 
N
N, consists of all integers from 
1
1 to 
N
N exactly once. For example, 
[
2
,
1
,
3
,
4
]
[2,1,3,4] is a permutation, while 
[

,
2
,
1
,
3
]
[2,2,1,3] is not.
