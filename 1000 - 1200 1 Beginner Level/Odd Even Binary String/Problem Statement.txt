Odd Even Binary String
Chef had an array 
A
A of length 
N
N such that 
1
≤
A
i
≤
N
1≤A 
i
​
 ≤N for all 
1
≤
i
≤
N
1≤i≤N. Chef constructed another binary array 
B
B of length 
N
N in the following manner:

B
i
=
1
B 
i
​
 =1 if the frequency of element 
i
i in 
A
A is odd.
B
i
=
0
B 
i
​
 =0 if the frequency of element 
i
i in 
A
A is even.
Such an array 
B
B is called the parity encoding array of 
A
A.

For example, if 
A
=
[
1
,
1
,
2
,
3
]
A=[1,1,2,3], then 
B
=
[
0
,
1
,
1
,
0
]
B=[0,1,1,0].

Unfortunately, Chef completely forgot the array 
A
A and vaguely remembers the parity encoding array 
B
B. He is now wondering whether there exists any valid array 
A
A for which the parity encoding array is 
B
B. Can you help Chef?
