Travel Pass

Chef is going on a road trip and needs to apply for inter-district and inter-state travel e-passes. 
It takes A minutes to fill each inter-district e-pass application and B minutes for each inter-state e-pass application.

His journey is given to you as a binary string S of length N where 0 denotes crossing from one district
 to another district (which needs an inter-district e-pass), and a 1 denotes crossing from one state to another (which needs an inter-state e-pass).
