Chef and Subarrays

Chef likes problems involving arrays. Unfortunately, the last one he tried to solve didn't quite get solved.

Chef has an array A of N positive numbers. He wants to find the number of subarrays for which the sum and product of elements are equal.

Please help Chef find this number.
