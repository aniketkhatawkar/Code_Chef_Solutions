Sign Moves
Initially, Chef is at coordinate 0 on X-axis. For each i=1,2,â€¦,N in order, Chef does the following:

If Chef is at a non-negative coordinate, he moves i steps backward (i.e, his position's coordinate decreases by i), 
otherwise he moves i steps forward (i.e, his position's coordinate increases by i).
You are given the integer N. Find the final position of Chef on the X-axis after N operations.
