Sort the String
You have a binary string 
S
S of length 
N
N. In one operation you can select a substring of 
S
S and reverse it. For example, on reversing the substring 
S
[
2
,
4
]
S[2,4] for 
S
=
11000
S=11000, we change 
1
100
0
→
1
001
0
11000→10010.

Find the minimum number of operations required to sort this binary string.
It can be proven that the string can always be sorted using the above operation finite number of times.
