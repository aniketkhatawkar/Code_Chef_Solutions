Alternating Binary String
You are given a binary string 
S
S of length 
N
N.
You can perform the following operation on it:

Choose an index 
i
i (
1
≤
i
≤
N
1≤i≤N), and flip every character of 
S
S from index 
i
i to 
N
N.
Flipping a character means turning it from 
0
0 to 
1
1 and vice versa.
For example, if 
S
=
1001101
S=1001101 and you choose 
i
=
4
i=4, the resulting string will be 
S
=
1000010
S=1000010.

Find the minimum number of operations required to turn 
S
S into an alternating string.
S
S is said to be an alternating string if 
S
i
≠
S
i
−
1
S 
i
​
 =S 
i−1
​
  for every 
i
i from 
2
2 to 
N
N.

It can be proved that it's always possible to turn 
S
S into an alternating string.
