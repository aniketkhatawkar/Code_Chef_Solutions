Chef is a visitor in CodeChef's new office. 
All doors inside the office require a swipe of access card.
The access card allows a fixed number of swipes and expires after that.

You are given a binary string S of length N and an integer X.
Let Si=0 denote the swipe of access card, thus reducing the remaining swipes by 1; 
and Si=1 denote a renewal of access card which sets the remaining swipes to X.

Find whether the string S denotes a valid string of renewal and swipes where the card never expires before a door is accessed.

Note that the access card has 0 swipes left in the beginning.
