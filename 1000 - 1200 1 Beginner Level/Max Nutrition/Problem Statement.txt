Max Nutrition
You are trying to be more healthy, and thus have decided to eat only fruits. You have lots of fruits of different types, but you get bored of a specific fruit type very quickly â€” so you will never repeat fruit types that you eat, i.e. you will eat at most one fruit of each type.

You have N fruits, the i-th fruit being of type Ai and providing you a nutrition value of Bi.
Some fruits are rotten, so Bi can be negative.

Find the maximum possible sum of nutrition values of the fruits you eat, under the constraint of never repeating fruit types.
Note that you may choose to eat no fruits as well, which would give you 0 nutrition.
