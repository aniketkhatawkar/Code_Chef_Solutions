Zero String
You are given a binary string S of length N. 
You are allowed to perform the following types of operations on string S:

Delete any one character from S, 
and concatenate the remaining parts of the string.
 
For example, if we delete the third character of S=1101, 
it becomes S=111.
Flip all the characters of S. 

For example, if we flip all character of 
S=1101, it becomes S=0010.
Given that you can use either type of operation any number of times, 
find the minimum number of operations required to make all characters of the string S equal to 0.
