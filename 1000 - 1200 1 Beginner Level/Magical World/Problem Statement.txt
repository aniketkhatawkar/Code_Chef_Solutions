Magical World
Alice has two coloured shapes:

A red rectangle with length A units, and width B units.
A blue square with an edge length of X units.
Alice lives in a magical world where the dimensions of red shapes can be changed.
Each change in dimension costs 1 unit of money, 
using which you can change any single dimension of a red object to any positive integer.

Alice wants to make the area of the blue square greater than or equal to the area of the red rectangle.
Find the minimum cost needed to make this possible.
