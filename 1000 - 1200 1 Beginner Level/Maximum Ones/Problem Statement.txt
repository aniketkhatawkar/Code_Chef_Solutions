Maximum Ones
You are given a binary string 
S
S of length 
N
N consisting only of characters 
0
0 and 
1
1. You are allowed to perform at most 
K
K operations on this string. In each operation, you can choose an index 
i
i (where 
0
≤
i
<
N
−
1
0≤i<N−1) and update the character at position 
i
i as follows:

S
i
=
max
⁡
(
S
i
,
S
i
+
1
)
S 
i
​
 =max(S 
i
​
 ,S 
i+1
​
 )
Here, the maximum is taken in the numerical sense, i.e., 
′
1
′
′
 1 
′
  is considered greater than 
′
0
′
′
 0 
′
 . This operation essentially means that if 
S
i
+
1
S 
i+1
​
  is 
′
1
′
′
 1 
′
 , then 
S
i
S 
i
​
  becomes 
′
1
′
′
 1 
′
  regardless of its previous value.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of 
1
1s in the string after performing at most 
K
K such operations.
