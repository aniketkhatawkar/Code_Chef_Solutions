Alternating String
A binary string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters of the string are equal. Formally, a binary string 
T
T of length 
M
M is called alternating if 
T
i

1
T

  for each

M
1≤i<M.

For example, 0, 1, 01, 10, 101, 010, 1010 are alternating strings while 11, 001, 1110 are not.

You are given a binary string 
S
S of length 
N
N. You would like to rearrange the characters of 
S
S such that the length of the longest alternating substring of 
S
S is maximum. Find this maximum value.

A binary string is a string that consists of characters 0 and 1. A string 
a
a is a substring of a string 
b
b if 
a
a can be obtained from 
b
b by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.
