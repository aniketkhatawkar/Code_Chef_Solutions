Weird Modulo Problem
You are given an array 
A
A of 
N
N positive and pairwise distinct integers. You can permute the elements in any way you want.

The cost of an ordering 
(
A

,
A
2
,
…
,
A
N
)
(A

​
 ,A 
2
​
 ,…,A 
N
​
 ) is defined as 
(

  where

Y. You need to find the maximum cost which can be attained through any possible ordering of the elements.
