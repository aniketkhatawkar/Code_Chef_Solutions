Sushil hates even numbers but he likes odd numbers, and thus wants to sure there are as many odd numbers as possible in the prefix sum array 
P
P. He is allowed to play with the array 
A
A and rearrange it arbitrarily. Find the maximum number of odd numbers in the prefix sum array 
P
P if Sushil rearranges the array 
A
A optimally.
