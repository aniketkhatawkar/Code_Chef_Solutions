Swapping Marks Digits

Alice scored A marks and Bob scored B marks in an exam. 
Both A and B are two-digit numbers that don't contain the digit 0.

Alice wants her marks to display higher than Bob's.
For this, she can reverse her score and/or Bob's score.
Is there a way for her score to display higher than Bob's?

For example, if 
A=37 and B=83, Alice can reverse her score to make it 
73, and also reverse Bob's score to make it
38, and now her score is higher.
