Chef and String
Chef has a string 
S
S consisting of lowercase English characters. Chef defined functions left shift 
L
(
X
)
L(X) and right shift 
R
(
X
)
R(X) as follows.

L
(
X
)
L(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string 
X
X one step towards left and moving the first character to the end.
R
(
X
)
R(X) is defined as shifting all characters of string 
X
X one step towards the right and moving the last character to the beginning.
For example, L("abcd") = "bcda" and R("abcd") = "dabc"

Chef wants to find out whether there exists a string 
V
V of the same length as 
S
S such that both 
L
(
V
)
=
S
L(V)=S and 
R
(
V
)
=
S
R(V)=S holds.
