Non-matching Name
Alice and Bob invented a brand-new algorithm - but they can't decide what to name it!

Alice suggested the name 
S
A
S 
A
​
 , and Bob suggested the name 
S
B
S 
B
​
 . (
S
A
S 
A
​
  and 
S
B
S 
B
​
  are both strings of lowercase English letters.)

However, Alice thinks Bob's naming sense is really bad - she'll only be happy if the name given to the algorithm is not close to 
S
B
S 
B
​
  at all.
More specifically, Alice will be happy if and only if the algorithm's name does not share any characters with 
S
B
S 
B
​
 .

Similarly, Bob thinks Alice's naming sense is really bad, and will only be happy if the algorithm's name doesn't share any characters with 
S
A
S 
A
​
 .

Is there a way to name the algorithm (using only lowercase English letters) so that both Alice and Bob are happy?
