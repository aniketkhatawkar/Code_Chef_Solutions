Merry Christmas!
Chef is planning Christmas festivities and has three activities to choose from:

Decorating a Christmas tree, which takes 1 hour.
Baking cookies, which takes 2 hours.
Making a gingerbread house, which takes 4 hours.
Given that Chef has X hours available, determine the maximum number of activities he can complete.

Note that no two activities can overlap in time.
