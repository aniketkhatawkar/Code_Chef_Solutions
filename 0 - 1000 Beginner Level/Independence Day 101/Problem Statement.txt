Independence Day 101
On the occasion of Independence Day, 
Chef wants to design a new flag for the country of Chefland.

He has some equal-sized strips in three different colors and needs to arrange them in a line 
so that no two adjacent strips share the same color.

Given that Chef has A orange strips, B white strips, 
and C green strips, determine if it is possible to design such a flag using all the strips.
