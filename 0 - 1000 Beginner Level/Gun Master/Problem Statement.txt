Gun Master

You have two guns: a close-range gun and a long-range gun.
The close-range gun can only shoot targets at distances less than or equal to D, 
while the long-range gun can only shoot targets at distances strictly greater than D.
You can only hold one gun at a time. Initially, you are holding the close-range gun.
You need to shoot at a series of N targets in order. The distance to the i-th target is Ai.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of times you need to switch between,
 the two guns to shoot all N targets in the given order.
