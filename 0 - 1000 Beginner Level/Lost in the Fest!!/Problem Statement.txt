Lost in the Fest!!
Bhoomi was excited for the annual fest at IIIT Pune. She found a spot in the queue, eagerly waiting for the performance. But there was a problem: tall students ahead blocked her view!
Frustrated, she wondered: "How much do I have to move to be able to see the performance?"

There are 
N
N students who want to watch the performance at the fest. They're standing in a straight queue, and the 
i
i-th student in the queue has a height of 
H
i
H 
i
​
 .

A student will be able to watch the performance if and only if they are strictly taller than every student ahead of them.
That is, student 
i
i will be able to watch the performance if and only if 
H
i
>
H
j
H 
i
​
 >H 
j
​
  for every 
1
≤
j
<
i
1≤j<i.

Bhoomi is the last student in the queue, with a height of 
H
N
H 
N
​
 .
Every second, she can swap places with the person just in front of her - that is, if she's currently at position 
i
i,
she can move to position 
i
−
1
i−1 (and the person previously at position 
i
−
1
i−1 will move to position 
i
i instead).
How many seconds will it take till Bhoomi is able to see the performance?
