Glass Prices
Chef is buying spectacles, and is now deciding on which frame to purchase.

Chef has narrowed his options down to two choices: a plastic frame that costs 
X
X rupees, and a metal frame that costs 
Y
Y rupees.

Chef will buy the metal frame if and only if it costs at most twice the price of the plastic frame - otherwise he will buy the plastic frame.

Can you decide which frame Chef will buy?
