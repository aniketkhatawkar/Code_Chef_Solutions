Divisible by 3
Stack likes the number 3 a lot.

He has two non-negative integers A and B.
In one operation, Stack can do either of the following A:=∣A−B∣ (change A to ∣A−B∣)
B:=∣A−B∣ (change B to ∣A−B∣)
Note that ∣X∣ denotes absolute value of X. 
For example ∣−7∣=7 and ∣4∣=4.
Find the minimum number of operations after which at least one integer out of A and B becomes divisible by 3.
