Make Arithmetic Progression
You are given three positive integers X,Y, and Z.
In one operation, you can choose any one of these values, and change it to any integer of your choice.

Find the minimum number of operations required to make the sequence 
(X,Y,Z) an arithmetic progression.
Note that (X,Y,Z) is an arithmetic progression if and only if Y−X=Z−Y.
