Ved and Varun are both members of Shaastra’s CnL team this year. While they are equally skilled in programming, they differ in height. Ved’s height is 
K
K, and Varun’s height is 
P
P.

Both want to watch a movie in OAT from outside the gate, without entering. There are 
N
N chairs available outside OAT, each with a height represented as 
A

​
 . These chairs can be stacked on top of each other to create a platform, allowing them to stand on it for a better view of the movie.

Tej, the OAT security officer, gives all the chairs to Varun, except for one - the tallest chair, which is given to Ved.

Now, Tej wants to know who will have a better view of the movie. If Ved has a better view, print 
Ved
Ved. If Varun has a better view, print 
Varun
Varun. If both have the same view, print 
Equal
Equal.

Note : A person is said to have a better view if they can get a better combined height by stacking their chairs and standing on top of them.
