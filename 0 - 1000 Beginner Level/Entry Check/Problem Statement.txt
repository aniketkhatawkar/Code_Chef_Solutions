Entry Check
Chef wants to visit a fair, but there is an age restriction for entry. A person can attend the fair if their age is greater than or equal to 10 years.

You are given Chef's age, represented by the integer X. Your task is to determine whether Chef is eligible to attend the fair or not.

If Chef's age is greater than or equal to 10, print "YES".
Otherwise, print "NO".
