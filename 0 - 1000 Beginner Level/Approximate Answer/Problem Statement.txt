Approximate Answer

You are solving a problem whose correct answer is the integer Y.
The answer you obtained, however, is the integer X.

Your answer will be considered correct if the difference between X and Y is at most K.
In other words, your answer is considered correct if and only if:∣X−Y∣≤K
Given the values of X, Y, and K, determine whether your answer X is correct or not.

Note that ∣x∣ denotes the absolute value of x.
For example, ∣12∣=12,∣−15∣=15, and ∣0∣=0.
