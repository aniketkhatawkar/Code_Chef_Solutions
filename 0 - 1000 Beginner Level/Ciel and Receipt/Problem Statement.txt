Ciel and Receipt
Tomya is a girl. She loves Chef Ciel very much.

Tomya likes a positive integer p, and now she wants to get a receipt of Ciel's restaurant whose total price is exactly p. The current menus of Ciel's restaurant are shown the following table.

Name of Menu			price
eel flavored water			1
deep-fried eel bones			2
clear soup made with eel livers		4
grilled eel livers served with grated radish	8
savory egg custard with eel		16
eel fried rice (S)			32
eel fried rice (L)			64
grilled eel wrapped in cooked egg		128
eel curry rice			256
grilled eel over rice			512
deluxe grilled eel over rice		1024
eel full-course			2048
Note that the i-th menu has the price 2i-1 (1 ≤ i ≤ 12).

So please find the minimum number of menus whose total price is exactly p. Note that if she orders the same menu twice, then it is considered as two menus are ordered. (See Explanations for details)
