Assignment Score
Chef has a total of N+1 assignments. He knows his score on the first N of them, and he is now working on his last assignment. His scores in the first N assignment are A1 ,A2,...,AN. Each of them are graded out of 100 marks, and his total marks is just a sum of all his N+1 assignment marks.
Chef is now worried about he might fail in his course. He will fail if he scores less than 50% of the total marks. Can you help Chef find what is the minimum score he needs to get to not fail? It may be impossible for Chef to pass, output âˆ’1 then.
