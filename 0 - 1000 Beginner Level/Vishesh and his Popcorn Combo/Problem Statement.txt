Vishesh has gone to watch the new Spider-Man movie, 
but he is having troubles choosing which Popcorn-and-Coke combo to buy.

There are three combos 
A, 
B, and 
C available at the counter. You are given the time (in minute) for which each Popcorn bucket and Coke cup lasts. Given that Vishesh's satisfaction from a combo is defined as the total lasting time (in minute) of the Popcorn bucket and the Coke cup, find the maximum satisfaction he can get by buying a single combo.
