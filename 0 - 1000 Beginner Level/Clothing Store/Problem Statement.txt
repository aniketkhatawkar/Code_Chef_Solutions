Clothing Store
Chef owns a clothing store and has a limited number of t-shirts in different sizes. There are three sizes available:

Small (
S
S): Chef has 
X
X small t-shirts.
Large (
L
L): Chef has 
Y
Y large t-shirts.
Extra Large (
X
L
XL): Chef has 
Z
Z extra-large t-shirts.
There are 
A
A people who wear small, 
B
B people who wear large, and 
C
C people who wear extra-large t-shirts.

Each person is happy if they receive a t-shirt in their desired size. However, Chef has a magical tailoring machine that allows him to convert larger shirts into smaller ones:

An 
X
L
XL t-shirt can be converted into an 
L
L or an 
S
S t-shirt.
An 
L
L t-shirt can be converted into an 
S
S t-shirt.
Conversions are one-way and irreversible.

Each conversion maintains a 
1
:
1
1:1 ratio (i.e., one 
X
L
XL can become exactly one 
L
L or one 
S
S). Chef wants to distribute the t-shirts optimally, making conversions if necessary, to maximize the number of happy people.

Can you determine the maximum number of people who will be happy?
