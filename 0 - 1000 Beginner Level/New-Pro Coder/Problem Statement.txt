New-Pro Coder
Hola a todos, espero que todo vaya bien!!

Ved claims to be a pro at programming, but his friend Varun disagrees. To settle the debate, they decided to seek advice from their mentor. The mentor proposed a simple challenge:

Ved must write a program containing N lines of code. When the code is compiled, the compiler will indicate how many of those lines have errors, denoted as M. Based on the results:

If errors are present in at least half of the total lines, Ved will be labeled as a NEWBIE Otherwise, he will be called a PRO
After compiling Ved's code, the compiler reported errors in M lines. Determine Ved's skill category based on this evaluation.
