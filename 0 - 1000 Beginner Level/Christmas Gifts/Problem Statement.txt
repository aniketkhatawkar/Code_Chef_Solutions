Christmas Gifts
Chef is wrapping Christmas gifts for his friends. He has a rectangular sheet of wrapping paper with a total area of 1000 square centimeters. Each identical gift is a rectangular box with dimensions:

Height (H) centimeters
Length (L) centimeters
Width (W) centimeters
To wrap a gift, Chef needs enough paper to cover all six faces of the box, with no overlapping or gaps. Calculate the maximum number of complete gifts Chef can wrap using the available wrapping paper.
