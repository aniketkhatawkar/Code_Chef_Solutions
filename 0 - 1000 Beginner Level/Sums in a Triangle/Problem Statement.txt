Sums in a Triangle
Given an integer 
N
N, let us consider a triangle of numbers of 
N
N lines in which a number 
a
11
a 
11
​
  appears in the first line, two numbers 
a
21
a 
21
​
  and 
a
22
a 
22
​
  appear in the second line, three numbers 
a
31
a 
31
​
 , 
a
32
a 
32
​
  and 
a
33
a 
33
​
  appear in the third line, etc. In general, 
i
i numbers 
a

a 
i1

 …a 
ii
​
  appear in the

th
  line for all

1≤i≤N. Develop a program that will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:

on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right.
