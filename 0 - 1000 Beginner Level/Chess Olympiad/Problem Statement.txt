Chess Olympiad
The 45-th FIDE Chess Olympiad is currently being held in Budapest, Hungary.

Every round, teams of four players each face off against each other in four individual games.
A team receives 1 point for winning a game, 0.5 points for a draw, and 0 points for a loss.

A team is said to win the round if they receive strictly more points than the opposing team.

In the current round, your favorite team has already won X games, drawn Y games, and lost Z games.
Can they still win this round?
