In your garden, there are exactly 
R red butterflies, 
G green butterflies and 
B blue butterflies.
There are also exactly 
R red flowers, 
G green flowers and 
B blue flowers.

Determine whether it is possible for every butterfly to feed on exactly one flower, such that:

No two butterflies feed on the same flower; and
Each butterfly feeds on a flower whose color is different from its own color.
For example, a red butterfly can only feed on green and blue flowers, not red flowers.
