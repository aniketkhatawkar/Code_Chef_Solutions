Too Many Oranges
Chef has N oranges with him. Each orange has either 0,11, or 12 slices.

Chef wanted to eat exactly K slices of orange. However, the oranges were too tasty, and Chef ended up eating all N of them!

Chef wasn't paying attention, so he didn't count the number of slices he ate, and he also doesn't know how many slices each orange had - the only thing he knows is that each orange has either 10,11, or 12 slices.

Is it possible that Chef ate exactly K slices from N oranges?
