Poster Perimeter
Chef wants to print out a poster on a rectangular piece of paper.

The piece of paper he uses cannot be too large, or his printer will be unable to handle it.
Specifically, the length of the rectangle must be an integer between 
1
1 and 
N
N units, and the width must be an integer between 
1
1 and 
M
M units.

Chef would like it if the perimeter of the paper is as close to 
K
K as possible.
If Chef chooses the paper's dimensions optimally, find the minimum possible difference between the paper's perimeter and 
K
K.
