Chef and Lockout Draws

Bob and Alice are having a lockout match between them. There are three problems in the contest worth 
A, B, and C points respectively. 
Only the first player to solve a problem gets points for that problem. 
It is impossible for Bob and Alice to solve a problem at the same time. 
Chef wants to know if there is any chance of a draw if Bob and Alice manage to solve all 
3 problems. 
A draw occurs when both players end with equal number of points.
