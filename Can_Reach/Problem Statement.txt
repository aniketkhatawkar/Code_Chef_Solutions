Can_Reach
A first-year student, came to your college. Being a good senior, you must tell him if it is possible to go from College Main Gate to Hostel for him.
The college can be visualized on a 2D-plane. Suppose the College Main Gate is situated at origin i.e. at the coordinates 
(0,0) and the Hostel is situated at the coordinates (x,y).
As the first-year student wants to explore the college campus further, in one move, he will increase or decrease any coordinate (either the x-coordinate or the y-coordinate) by a value of exactly K.

Is it possible for the first-year student to reach the Hostel?
